Before we get into the details of how to use the free spins and coins links, letâ€™s talk about why they are so important in the game. Coin Master is all about spins and coins. 

- **Spins:** You need spins to spin the *slot machine*. Each spin costs one spin, and the outcomes can range from rewards like coins and cards to attacks and raids. The more spins you have, the more chances you get to earn coins, complete your card collection, or attack other players.

Without enough spins and coins, your progress can come to a halt. Thatâ€™s why it's so helpful to get them for free!
